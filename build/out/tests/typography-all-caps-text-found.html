  <title>Tool Audit Test - All caps text found</title>
</head>
<body>
  
<p class="all-caps">Typing sentences or phrases IN ALL CAPITALS is rarely a good idea. It may make sense under some circumstances, but only rarely. Lengthy segments of capitalized content are more difficult to read. In some cases, a screen reader may interpret ALL CAPITAL text as being an acronym and may read it as letters rather than words. For example, a screen reader may read the uppercase text CONTACT US as "Contact U. S." because it interprets the uppercase "US" as being an acronym for "United States".</p>
