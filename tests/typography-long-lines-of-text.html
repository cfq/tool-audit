  <title>Tool Audit Test - Long lines of text</title>
</head>
<body>
  
<p>For people with some reading or vision disabilities, long lines of text can become a significant barrier. They have trouble keeping their place and following the flow of text. Having a narrow block of text makes it easier for them to continue on to the next line in a block. Lines should not exceed 80 characters</p>
